Student: University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign class of 2022, Economics and Business and Computer Science. Personally, I am very fortunate to have experienced engagements in Immigration Law, Financial Services, Data Analytics as well as Non-Profit Organizations, which have really helped to shape a legal and financial foundation for my future.

When I am not studying, or working, I spend my time practicing Kathak (Indian Classical Dance), debating, or writing.
